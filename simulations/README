## description of files required to reproduce simulation analysis

# simulatedGWAS/ : 	A directory containing 24 .RDS files for the 24 LD blocks on chromosome 22 (found using LD detect method)
				Each file contains a list of 102 data.frames containing results from 102 simulated GWASs
				Each data.frame has columns: 
				z (simulated z score), 
				p (simulated p-value), 
				CV (binary indicator of causal variant), 
				pos (genomic position of SNP), 
				block (LD block), 
				r2_CVrow* (r^2 values of the SNP with CV on row *), 
				max_r2 (the maximum r^2 of the SNP with any of the CVs in this LD block).
				
				(the source file to make these .RDS files is omitted due to the requirement of 
				very large haplotype files. They can be made available upon request)
				
#Â simweights.RDS: 	An .RDS file containing LDAK weights for the 80356 SNPs on chromosome 22

# sim*/: 			Directories containing the code to simulate results from simulation scenarios A-E

# figures/: 			Directory containing code to reproduce Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 from the main manuscript
